<b>TWLCaptureSystemWriter</b> is used to update the firmware of IS-TWL-CAPTUREs. The readme for this tool says it is meant for use on a "mass production basis", being an alternative to <a href="/dsidev/twl_eva_import.html">TWL EVA IMPORT</a>, which installs the final firmware. There is a complete v2725-9336 prototype firmware included in TWLCaptureSystemWriter's source code.<br><br>
