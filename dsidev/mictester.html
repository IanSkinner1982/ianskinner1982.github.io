        Mic Tester (also known as <b>MIC</b>) is a version of Nitro EVA used to test the DS microphone and speakers. There are two known versions of Mic Tester.
        <h3>2007/05/07 (v4):</h3>
        This comes with 4 major tests, as well as some of the usual Nitro EVA tests:
        <br><code> - SOUND</code>, Plays some simple sound effects and music to test the speakers
        <br><code> - MIC</code>, A few microphone tests. One is the <code>SAMPLING DATA GRAPH</code>, which displays a real time graph of the mic input.
        <br><code> - MIC CHECKER</code>, Appears to be another microphone test, though it's impossible to use as it requires special factory hardware
        <br><code> - SPEAKER TESTER</code>, Plays a tone in the left and right speakers to make sure they're working

        <h3>2008/12/01:</h3>
        This later version has had nearly  feature stripped, with the exception of <code>SPEAKER TESTER</code>. The Nitro EVA menu is not accessible, and none the tests mentioned above are included.
