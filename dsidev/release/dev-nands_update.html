<h1>MangaON DSi Update: Build recovered</h1>
<p>In September of 2023 we released a small <a href="/dsidev/release/dev-nands.html">lot of NANDs</a>. Included was a development DSi used at <a href="https://www.inside-games.jp/article/img/2008/12/20/32805/62896.html" target="_blank">Jump Festa 2009</a> to show off a demo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090205212450/http://nintendo.joystiq.com/2008/12/22/japan-now-to-have-two-wiiware-manga-services/" target="_blank">MangaON</a>, a cancelled digital manga service for the DSi and Wii. When we first found the unit we had assumed the demo build was overwritten. We recently learned it was just fragmented (spread in pieces across NAND), and <b>MrPinball64</b> was able to piece it back together!<br><br>The build contains short manga for Naruto, One Piece, and Dragonball.<br>
