<b>TP_CAL</b> is used to test the DSi touch screen in the factory. There are 3 TP_CAL modes listed in all TWL EVA versions. 
<ul>
<li><b>TP CALIBRATION</b>, calibrates the touch screen.</li>
<li><b>TP ACCURACY</b> is then used to test the calibration.</li>
<li><b>TEST TP JIG</b> requires you to touch markers on the screens and has extremely low tolerances. Perhaps this was meant to be used in a factory <i>jig</i> that allows for precisely touching the DSi touch screen?</li>
</ul>
Below is a list of tests contained in each TP_CAL mode:
