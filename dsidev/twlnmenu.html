TwlNmenu is a tool used to manage installed software on the NAND. It can install programs in the TAD format (similar to the Wii's WADs) as well as boot and delete programs. TwlNmenu has three modes: NAND, SD, and CARD. 
<h2>NAND mode</h2>
In NAND mode you can boot, delete, and get info for programs installed to NAND. Only user programs are visible (anything in <code>nand:/title/00030004/</code>). The controls are as follows:
        <table class="menu">
            <tr>
                <th class="menuheader">Button</th>
                <th class="menuheader">Purpose</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem">START</td>
                <td class="menuitem">Boot the selected program.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem">X</td>
                <td class="menuitem">Delete the selected program. Deleting once will remove the app + tmd but keep the ticket as "proof" it was installed. Press <b>X</b> again to fully remove the program.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem">R + X</td>
                <td class="menuitem">Delete all programs of the same type. For example, pressing <b>R + X</b> on a broken program will delete all broken programs, and pressing <b>R + X</b> on an installed program will remove all installed programs.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem">Y</td>
                <td class="menuitem">Delete the private save data of the selected program.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
The top screen will display information such as the company code, game code, and sizes of the app and save data. NAND mode also displays the status of installed programs. This is shown by highlighting the program name in a specific color.
        <table class="menu">
            <tr>
                <th class="menuheader">Color</th>
                <th class="menuheader">Status</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem"><span style="color:black;">Black</span></td>
                <td class="menuitem">The title is installed without errors.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem"><span style="color:blue;">Blue</span></td>
                <td class="menuitem">The title was deleted from NAND (has a leftover ticket, but no app + tmd).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem"><span style="color:red;">Red</span></td>
                <td class="menuitem">The title is broken (bad app), or it was installed improperly (has an app + tmd, but missing/bad ticket).</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
<h2>SD mode</h2>
SD mode allows you to select and install TAD files to NAND from the SD card.
<br><br>
<h4>Quick explaination of TADs</h4>
TADs are essentially SRLs (NDS ROMs) that have been packaged into an installable format. TADs are very similar to the Wii's WADs, sharing the same offsets and signing. A <a href="https://github.com/rvtr/TwlIPL/commit/baca65d35d5d62d815c88e6374b895d5b0755277">commit in TwlIPL</a> explains the similarity by showing that TADs were derived from WADs.
<br><br>
TAD files are created with <a href="/dsidev/man/maketad.html" target="_blank">maketad</a> from the TWL SDK. Only NAND apps such as DSiWare can be coverted into TADs.
<br><br>
Signing in TADs is very important when installing. If a TAD is not signed for the target console (eg. dev signing on a retail DSi) then <code>TwlNmenu</code> will fail. Anything created with the standard <code>maketad</code> will be dev signed and only work on dev units, though there is also a <code>maketad_updater</code> used for updater signing in <a href="">Twl SystemUpdater</a>.

                <th class="menuheader">Button</th>
                <th class="menuheader">Purpose</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem">A</td>
                <td class="menuitem">Install the selected TAD.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="menuitem">R + A</td>
                <td class="menuitem">Install all TADs in the current directory.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
