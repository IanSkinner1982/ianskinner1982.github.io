<b>NandInitializer</b> is a collection of tests used to set up a DSi NAND. It allows for creating system files, installing firmware and a bootloader, formatting NAND, region changing, and more. NandInitializer seems to be most directly related to <a href="/dsidev/twl_eva_pre_import.html">TWL EVA</a>, possibly being the main inspiration or starting point. There are 3 versions available:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><b>NandInitializerRed:</b> a fully featured version of the app. This is only meant for Nintendo's Research and Engineering Department.</li>
    <li><b>NandInitializerProduction:</b> an automatic version of the app. Menu selection is disabled and you are limited to the pre-determined test order.</li>
    <li><b>NandInitializer:</b> a very limited version of the app. You are only able to change HWInfo, and test/cleanup the NAND.</li>
</ul>
There are no compiled versions of NandInitializer, but the below documents have a photo of the production version running.<br><br>
